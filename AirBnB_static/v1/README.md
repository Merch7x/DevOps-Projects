# AIRBNB_STATIC v1
In this iteration of the project most things will be self managed.
## This means that we will manage
  monitoring by creating our own monitoring endpoints for various metrics and logs.
  Data by creating and managing our own database with enabled replication.
  Load-balancing by creating and configuring a load balancing server.
