Terraform is a infrastructure provisioning tool that leverages IAC I nfrastructure As Code to provision resources either locally or on the cloud.
It keeps the state of your infrastrucure and makes it easy to add or remove resources.

In this project I use Terraform to provision 2 Ec2 t2-micro instances connected to a security group in a the default vpc. Moreover the instances are connceted to an Elastic Load Balancer and s3 bucket.
